## NC²--SVB
NC²--SVB is a collaborative video recovery system based on network coding designed for scalable video broadcasting (SVB). It enables functions such as packet generation, network coding, decoding, and packet loss recovery, particularly in scenarios involving proximate user nodes with device-to-device (D2D) communication. The system operates in a feedback-free environment, where the source node transmits without receiving feedback on reception status or channel conditions. By incorporating a sliding window mechanism and scheduling for coding video layers, NC²--SVB allows user nodes to autonomously generate optimal coding packets and collaborate with their D2D partners to recover lost packets. Compared to traditional methods, NC²--SVB improves collaboration throughput, enhances decoding rates, and reduces decoding delays, making it highly efficient for video broadcasting scenarios.

## Building Guides:
### System Development Environment：
>Developed in Java based on the Android Studio platform, Windows 10.

### System operating environment：
>The NC²--SVB simulation program runs on Android emulators or real mobile devices. To ensure smooth operation, the Android version of the emulator or mobile device should be Android 6.0 or higher.
