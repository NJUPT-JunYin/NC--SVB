## NC²--SVB
NC²--SVB is a collaborative video recovery system based on network coding designed for scalable video broadcasting (SVB). The system facilitates functions such as packet generation, network coding, decoding, and packet loss recovery, particularly in environments involving proximate user nodes with device-to-device (D2D) communication. It operates in a feedback-free setting, where the source node transmits without receiving feedback on reception status or channel conditions. By incorporating a sliding window mechanism and scheduling for coding video layers, NC²--SVB allows user nodes to autonomously generate optimal coding packets and collaborate with their D2D partners to recover lost packets. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, NC²--SVB improves collaboration throughput, enhances decoding rates, and reduces decoding delays, making it highly efficient for video broadcasting applications.

## Building Guides:
### System Development Environment：
>Developed in Java based on the Android Studio platform, Windows 10.

### System operating environment：
>The simulation program runs on Android emulators or real mobile devices. To ensure smooth operation, the Android version of the emulator or mobile device should be Android 6.0 or higher.

### System operation instructions：

#### Running the Simulation Program on the PC:
>Setting up the Emulator:
* In Android Studio on your PC, set up a suitable Android emulator (virtual device) that meets the required specifications (Android 6.0 or higher). This emulator will act as the environment in which the NC2-SVB program runs.

>Running in the Emulator:
* Install the NC2-SVB app on the emulator.
* Launch the app within the emulator by clicking the app icon.

>Executing the NC2-SVB Scheme:
In the NC2-SVB app, you will find buttons corresponding to different simulation actions and parameter settings.
Click the appropriate buttons within the app interface to execute the corresponding NC2-SVB schemes.
The app will display real-time simulation parameters and results on the emulator screen, allowing you to observe the performance of the collaborative recovery process.

>Observing Simulation Results:
The NC2-SVB app will showcase relevant metrics such as throughput, decoding rate, and delay directly within the app interface.
