## NC²--SVB
NC²--SVB is a collaborative video recovery system based on network coding designed for scalable video broadcasting (SVB). The system facilitates functions such as packet generation, network coding, decoding, and packet loss recovery, particularly in environments involving proximate user nodes with device-to-device (D2D) communication. It operates in a feedback-free setting, where the source node transmits without receiving feedback on reception status or channel conditions. By incorporating a sliding window mechanism and scheduling for coding video layers, NC²--SVB allows user nodes to autonomously generate optimal coding packets and collaborate with their D2D partners to recover lost packets. Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, NC²--SVB improves collaboration throughput, enhances decoding rates, and reduces decoding delays, making it highly efficient for video broadcasting applications.

## Building Guides:
### System Development Environment：
>Developed in Java based on the Android Studio platform, Windows 10.

### System operating environment：
>The simulation program runs on Android emulators. For optimal performance, the Android version of the emulator should be Android 6.0 or higher.

### System operation instructions：

#### Running the Simulation Program on the PC:
>Setting up the Emulator:
>* In Android Studio on your PC, set up a suitable Android emulator (virtual device) that meets the required specifications (Android 6.0 or higher). This emulator will serve as the environment for running the simulation program.

>Running in the Emulator:
>* Install the simulation app on the emulator.
>* Launch the app within the emulator by clicking its icon.

>Executing Simulation of Different Approaches:
>* Click the relevant buttons within the app interface to execute corresponding approaches.
>* The app will display simulation parameters and results on the emulator screen, allowing you to observe the performance of different collaborative recovery process.

>Observing Simulation Results:
>* The simulation app will showcase relevant metrics such as throughput, decoding rate, and delay directly within the app interface.
