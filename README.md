## NC²--SVB
NC²--SVB is a collaborative video recovery system based on network coding designed for scalable video broadcasting (SVB). It enables functions such as packet generation, network coding, decoding, and packet loss recovery, particularly in scenarios involving proximate user nodes with device-to-device (D2D) communication. The system operates in a feedback-free environment, where the source node transmits without receiving feedback on reception status or channel conditions. By incorporating a sliding window mechanism and online scheduling for coding video layers, NC2–SVB allows user nodes to autonomously generate optimal coding packets and collaborate with their D2D partners to recover lost packets. Compared to traditional methods, NC2–SVB improves collaboration throughput, enhances decoding rates, and reduces decoding delays, making it highly efficient for video broadcasting scenarios.
